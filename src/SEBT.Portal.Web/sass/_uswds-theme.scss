USWDS Theme Configuration
----------------------------------------
This file loads USWDS with state-specific theme settings.
State theme is loaded via auto-generated _uswds-theme-entry.scss
which is regenerated during build based on STATE environment variable.

Build commands:
  pnpm build        # Defaults to DC
  STATE=dc pnpm build
  STATE=co pnpm build
*/

// Forward the auto-generated theme entry (loads state-specific theme + USWDS core)
@forward "uswds-theme-entry";
