We use [Lightweight Architecture Decision Records](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) 
for tracking architectural decisions, using [adr tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) to
store them in source control. These can be found in the [docs/adr](./docs/adr) folder.
